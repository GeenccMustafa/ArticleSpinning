# Article Spinning with Python

This repository contains a Python script for text document spinning, allowing you to generate variations of articles while preserving the original context and meaning. Article spinning can be useful for content creators, writers, and marketers looking to produce unique content efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `nltk`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip`:
   
pip install numpy pandas nltk

3. Download the NLTK tokenizer models:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')


### Usage
1. Download the dataset for BBC text document classification from Kaggle: BBC Text Document Classification Dataset.

2. Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script (article_spinning.py) to perform article spinning.

3. The script reads the dataset from the CSV file, extracts text data for a specific label (e.g., 'sport'), and then applies text spinning to generate variations of the selected text.

4. Adjust the spinning parameters as needed, including word replacement probabilities.

5. The spun documents are printed with text wrapping to enhance readability.
